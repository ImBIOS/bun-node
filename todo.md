# TODO

- [ðŸš€] Refactor versioning and tagging to more maintainable format
- [ ] Remove 14 and 16 after successful first build as docker-node does not support them already
- [ ] Add a test for the docker-node image

## Build Plan

- [x] Get latest version list from node and bun
- [x] Plan routine checks for new versions
- [x] Plan workflow to build only new versions
