This repository offers pre-configured Docker images combining [Bun](https://bun.sh/), with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), the popular JavaScript runtime. Ideal for development, testing, and production environments.

Use node.js as runtime, and bun as package manager, etc. The node.js in this docker image functions as fallback when bun is not implement the feature yet.
